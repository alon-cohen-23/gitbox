# gitboxGitbox is a seamless file synchronization tool designed to automatically track and update files across multiple machines within a shared Git repository. Much like Dropbox, Gitbox ensures that any changes made on one device are instantly reflected across all other devices connected to the same repository. It operates in the background, leveraging Git for version control and synchronization, making it ideal for teams or individuals who need to keep files in sync without manual effort.Using a combination of watchdog for file change detection and a Git-based sync mechanism, Gitbox automatically commits, pulls, and pushes changes to keep everything in sync. With features like automated notifications and error handling, it makes sure that youâ€™re always up to date, even when the changes involve conflicts or require merges.# Storage Considerations with GitboxGitbox uses Git and Git Large File Storage (LFS) to manage and synchronize files across multiple devices.The available storage capacity depends on the hosting platform you choose for your Git repository.For instance, GitHub provides free users with 1 GB of storage for Git repositories and 1 GB of bandwidth forGit LFS files, while GitLab offers 10 GB of storage per project.If you will ran out of storage, there is always the possability of just creating a new repo can always open a new repo.    | Feature                   |   Gitbox   | Dropbox Free |    |---------------------------|------------|--------------|    | **Storage Capacity**      | unlimited  | 2 GB         |    | **User Restrictions**     | Unlimited  | 1 user       |    | **Device Restrictions**   | Unlimited  | 3 devices max|
